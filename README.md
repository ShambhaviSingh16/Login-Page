# Login Page 🚪
 This project is a modern, interactive login form created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The design focuses on user engagement by incorporating a dynamic hover effect for the login button and real-time input validation. The form is not just functional but also visually appealing, making the user experience more enjoyable.


## ✨ Features and Components:
- **Username Input:** The user can enter their username in this field.
- **Password Input:** The user can enter their password, and the input is obscured for security.
- **Interactive Login Button:** The button shifts dynamically when hovered or clicked, enhancing user engagement.
- **Real-Time Validation:** The form validates the fields as the user types, providing feedback and disabling the button until all fields are filled.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is flexible and adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience across devices.
- **Messages:** Provides real-time feedback to the user, including error or success messages.
- **Remember Me Checkbox:** An optional checkbox for remembering the user's login details.
  

## Technologies Used: 🖥️
- **HTML:** For the structure of the page.
- **CSS:** For styling and animations, including hover effects and form layout.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity, form validation, and dynamic button positioning.
  

## 🔍 How It Works:
- The JavaScript code listens for user input and checks if both the username and password fields are filled. If so, the login button is enabled and provides a success message.
- When the user hovers over the login button, it shifts to a random direction.
- The form provides feedback to the user through messages that indicate whether the form can be submitted.


## 🌱 To Do / Future Improvements:
- Implement actual backend authentication using a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Python).
- Add a registration page where new users can create an account.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for smaller screen sizes.
- Add animations or transitions for form validation.
